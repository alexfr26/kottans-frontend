## Git Basics

I understood that I hadn't realize all advantages of using GIT.  
This multipurpose tool helps us manage different versions of our project, track changes in any files and save them in the local or/and remote repositories.

The most difficult part of course was figuring out how to resolve merge conflicts.

Wow! That was fairly difficult and interesting at the same time to undestand things I haven't known about HTTP before. So it became more clear how HTTP requests/responses work. I've learned new Metods (like TRACE), Status Codes and some usefull Headers. In addition to this, I read some articles about CORS and how to solve CORS-problem.
